            <p style="justify-content: center; align-items: center;">The first design of my webpage was from myself. I wanted to make a scrolldown type one. Although I took some css from<br> some brilliant youtuber like CodeWithHarry and Mr. Web Designer.I created my own design using paint and photoshop. I did some wireframe with the help of Balsamiq Wireframes.
                The image of website is below:<br>
                <img src = "/picture/DESIGN.png" class = "firstimg">
                <br>
                <h2 style="color: whitesmoke" >Expected webpage</h2>
            </p>
            <br>
                <hr>
                <br>
            <p style="justify-content: center; align-items: center;">This is site where i take my ideas from and implement it in my html webpage. But this was something I came with later.<br>
                Before that I had another plan that was going. I also built other website using this technique like here done in this website.<br> The website is below:</p>
                <a href = "#" class = link>
                <img src ="/picture/2022-04-06 (1).png" class = "secondimg"> <br> Click here or photo</a>
                <br>
                <hr>
                <P style="justify-content: center; align-items: center;">I also tried from this video from youtube. I downloaded the source code and tried several option. <br> I also happen to fit my own ideas on the webpage but it does not display the website. The way i wanted to view. <br> Something like from above figure/ picture which was my actual design of the website.</P>

                Before finalizing my website for this coursework. <br> I had made one website just for the demo to see how does css and html work <br> together with Javascript.
